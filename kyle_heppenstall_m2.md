## Areas of Emphasis

My focus on personal growth in this module is working with other students on projects. I would like to be a bit more flexible and learning-oriented (as opposed to outcome-oriented) on the team projects. Last module I tended to take the lead on the projects and did not always do the best job making sure my partner and I stayed on the same page throughout the project. This module I want to focus on DTR and more frequent retros to improve as a team member.

Technically I am most excited about learning more about databases this module. I would like to incorporate data analytics / visualization in my projects as much as possible. In addition to the standard module 2 curriculum, I am also hoping to stay fresh on my Ruby and learn some Python. I want to continue to do exercisms in both languages and finish the python CodeAcademy course.

Regarding community, pairing with module 2 students was really helpful or me in module 1 so I would like to be available at least 2 times per week throughout the module to pair with a module 1 student. I would also like to help out at one of the Try Turing days. Lastly, I want to continue to be a part of the Armstrong posse and take a more active role in organizing events/sessions with the posse.

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
