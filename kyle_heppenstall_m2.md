# Kyle Heppenstall - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My focus on personal growth in this module is working with other students on projects. I would like to be a bit more flexible and learning-oriented (as opposed to outcome-oriented) on the team projects. Last module I tended to take the lead on the projects and did not always do the best job making sure my partner and I stayed on the same page throughout the project. This module I want to focus on DTR and more frequent retros to improve as a team member.

Technically I am most excited about learning more about databases this module. I would like to incorporate data analytics / visualization in my projects as much as possible. In addition to the standard module 2 curriculum, I am also hoping to stay fresh on my Ruby and learn some Python. I want to continue to do exercisms in both languages and finish the python CodeAcademy course.

Regarding community, pairing with module 2 students was really helpful or me in module 1 so I would like to be available at least 2 times per week throughout the module to pair with a module 1 student. I would also like to help out at one of the Try Turing days. Lastly, I want to continue to be a part of the Armstrong posse and take a more active role in organizing events/sessions with the posse.

### Group Projects

#### [Bike Share](https://github.com/kheppenstall/bike-share)
* [DTR Memo](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/2e7f74c2b88794f883a021b6d90aed08)

##### Description

Bike Share was our first team project at Turing. We made a web application with CRUD functionality and data anlytics for stations, trips, and weather conditions.

Our team stayed late and demonstrated commitment and work ethic. We were willing and ready to resolve conflict on the team while keeping the big picture in mind (and while not being defensive).  We taught each other and did a great job putting learning first. Our work flow of two people pairing and one person working individually kept our pace high. Styling was consistent across all pages.

For deltas, we could have used Waffle more often and organized the waffle page better. Our agile approach was not always on point. We should have wrapped up the stations chunk better before moving on to further iterations. The organization of our models directory could have been clearer. We should have focused more on base expectations instead of adding extra features (time cap them). We could have been more detail-oriented when merging pull requests (and creating pull requests that are more discrete and smaller). Communication was too reliant on everyone being here. Styling was minimalist.


##### Evaluation


The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

  * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. ActiveRecord

  * 3.5: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

3. User Experience and Conventions

  * 3.5: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

4. Code Organization/Quality

  * 4: Code is organized so that the main application file is primarily concerned with HTTP requests/responses. Other logic is refactored to be included in other Ruby objects, and code responsible for analyzing information in the database exists in the appropriate ActiveRecord models. Methods are appropriately refactored to have a specific purpose and generally do not exceed eight to ten lines. The purpose of methods is generally clear and easy to understand/follow. Logic is not included in ERB views, and is instead in the controller or model as appropriate.

5. Testing

  * 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

6. Working Collaboratively

  * 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.


### Individual Projects


##### Feedback

From Josh: NEG: Remember your coworkers are adults, and will need a different teaching style. POS: You’re a rare combination of work ethic and raw intelligence.  It was a pleasure working with you.

From Drew: Don't take on too much work. Kyle did too much work, even after like 8-9 hours of working at school. If there is something Kyle feels NEEDS to be done, even after a day's work,  he should ask  group members for help. Most students at Turing  work hard and are willing to go the extra mile to finish a project. Don't burn yourself out. You-are-awesome Feedback:  I think our collaborative work styles really meshed well together. Had a ton of fun working on this project with Kyle. Kyle is an excellent coder, and there is a ton to learn from him. I would be very pleased to work with Kyle again.

(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Micro-Aggressions

* [Micro-Aggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

My biggest takeaways from the micro-aggressions gear up were from the readings. The New York Times article provides some examples of microagressions and presents ‘microagression’ as the vocabulary to talk about these everyday incidents. Over time micro aggressions can take their toll on psyche and hinder success. I had never thought about the claim that the tech monoculture, although appealing to some, is “draining the talent pool.” Thinking about micro aggressions on a larger scale and the impact on the industry is an interesting perspective. The month of microagressions article was really interesting for me. Reading all the micro aggressions Chee experienced in a month made it easier for me to start to understand how they can add up and seriously impact someone over time. One way forward my group discussed was more story sharing. Reading testimonials or listening to people tell their experiences is a great way to learn about microagressions and help me be more aware about the impact of what I say.

* [Job Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-_WJWX8b_IXianFk5j1SLe51R45iT0mDW_rF3ir0BcI/edit?usp=drive_web)

My biggest takeaways here were around the process of finding a job. Meg emphasized that it is better to look for companies you are interested in and reach out to them versus looking for online job postings. We then went on to research companies we are interested in and start a job tracker to stay organized in communicating with them.

#### Collaborative Communication

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_two/collaborative_communication.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]() --- See two paragraphs below

This sessions focused around project management. It detailed some tools to consider (like Waffle.io) and how we can leverage our strengths to help a team. My biggest takeaway was around building a culture of error within a team. I thought it was really interesting how teams that are not afraid to fail perform better (and probably have more fun).

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)


#### Bike Share team

Drew: On bike share Drew did an excellent job working collaboratively in a way that worked for the team. He was always available for questions, asked for help when he needed help but still worked independently to get tasks finished. He also did a great job reminding the team to understand code and practice typing it out from memory. My constructive feedback was to take more ownership on figuring out the best way to accomplish tasks like writing dashboard methods. He was hesitant to switch to ActiveRecord from Ruby at first even though it was in the spec and made the pages load faster.

Josh: Josh’s communication was a strength for the team on the project. He was on Slack the most, never merged any pull requests without consulting the team, and aired conflict when it came up. He also demonstrated great follow through on tasks he was working on, like the CRUD functionality for weather conditions. My constructive feedback would be to ask more questions early to avoid falling behind on topics like the ActiveRecord methods and pagination. That could mean going home less or spending more time at school or asking to screenhero to talk about code.

# Portfolio Rubric

For Module 2, your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations. If you were exempt from the assessment it's a *3*.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4"s on the assessment (Module 3 requires three or more "4"s)
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual & Group Work

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, delivers a high-quality product, and works to maximize their skill growth.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results and demonstrates excellent growth by pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work and may demonstrate some lack of engagement or growth in their individual skill.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams and does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Professional Skills

A Turing student values professional growth and seeks opportunities to continuously improve.

* 4: Student demonstrates dedication to their professional growth by not only completing the expected deliverable(s) but also pursuing additional opportunities for professional development beyond what is presented in sessions.
* 3: Student demonstrates satisfactory dedication, understanding, and growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of understanding or growth of professional development through their deliverables from PD sessions.
* 1: Student puts minimal effort into deliverable(s), does not follow directions, or is off topic.
* 0: Student does not complete the deliverable(s).

## D: Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior. They have a significant positive
positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback. They participate in required
activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student gives meaningful impact to peers as well as being aware of themes
in the feedback they receive. They participate in most required community activities
such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
* 1: Student does not consistently participate in or construct meaningful peer
feedback. They stay in their lane and focuses on just their own learning.

## E: Community Participation

A Turing student works to build up the community around them by participating and supporting other students,
the larger Turing family, and persons outside our walls who want to develop
their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant positive impact on the learning and spirit of the people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two above and beyond suports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities such as demos, lightning talks, improv, but does not do anything else of
significance.
