# Kyle Heppenstall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main area of emphasis in this module is to figure out what fields and technologies in software developement I'm most interested in. I want to do more exploring of a new language like Python and Elixir. I'm looking forward to working on a personal project and have the goal of consuming and analyzing some data from a couple APIs and then hosting the collected data in my own API. Concerning the community at large, I want to keep pairing with students in Mod 1 and Mod 2 and continue to make more connections with the people in my own module. I also want to continue to attend and contribute something to the Armstrong Posse, hopefully by running a session or a small group focused on learning Python.

(Intro)

#### Rales Engine

In this project I worked with Nick E to host our first API. We import business data and host an API with endpoints to return records, relationships between models, and business intelligence as JSON. During our evaluation Sally gave us some positive feedback on our organization structure.  test coverage, queries, and git workflow. Overall, our queries all used ActiveRecord except for our random controllers (`Customer.all.sample`).

Evaluator: Sally

Students: Nick E & Kyle


## Project Rubric

1. **Completion**

    * 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

1. **Test-Driven Development**

    * 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

1. **Code Quality**

    * 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

1. **API Design**

    * 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

1. **Queries**

    * 3.5: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

During this gear up we spent the first bit of time exploring the Parable of the Polygons interactive blog post. Applying the ideas to tech, if executives (or anyone making hiring decisions) seeks teams were even one third of the members are like them then there will be segregated availabilities according to who is ‘like’ the decision-maker in this case. To be honest I had not though through diversity quotas too much previously. Based on the Potp, it seems essential to have a threshold for the the maximum number of people like you in your area.  Diversity quotas, even if small, could help provide this threshold. Another way to provide this threshold would be through personal expectations. If you are only willing to work at an area with a certain level of diversity, you are steering the trend toward a more diverse workforce.

#### Automation and the Future

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

We started this gear up watching a few depressing videos on automation. I found it interesting that the videos suggested professional and creative work being automated at rates similar to the blue collar work I traditionally associated with being vulnerable to automation. In groups we started discussing about the impacts automation could have on society going forward. We discussed options like a more significant safety net, lowering the hours in a work week, universal basic income, and lowering the retirement age. We also raised the idea that society needs to change its concept around unemployment - stop blaming the unemployed and consider the option that the person is without a job to no fault of their own.

### PROtocol

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/1930f63ab3978c60665a0e804cc72d88/edit)

This session was really helpful to think about my priorities when starting to job search. I had not thought too much about the question of what people I like to work with so I enjoyed thinking through what I'm looking for in colleagues. I'm looking forward to using my flower exercise to help with selecting jobs to apply for and interviews.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

This session was definitely helpful in getting some ideas going for the personal project. I actually came up with an idea I used for my personal project during the session. The idea of not rejecting any ideas and running with each one was helpful for me since I tend to be overly selective instead of just brainstorming openly.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Nick E (Rales Engine): Overall I loved working with you on Rales Engine and hopefully we get to work together again! My constructive from this project is to have more explicit discussions with teammates about the tradeoff between getting something done and doing it as well as possible (importer tests, for example). My positive feedback is that you do an excellent job problem-solving and knowing the tools to troubleshoot. You also do a great job holding people accountable to using specific vocabulary which lets you have higher level discussions about code more easily.
