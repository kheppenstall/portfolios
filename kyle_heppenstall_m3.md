# Kyle Heppenstall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main area of emphasis in this module is to figure out what fields and technologies in software developement I'm most interested in. I want to do more exploring of a new language like Python and Elixir. I'm looking forward to working on a personal project and have the goal of consuming and analyzing some data from a couple APIs and then hosting the collected data in my own API. Concerning the community at large, I want to keep pairing with students in Mod 1 and Mod 2 and continue to make more connections with the people in my own module. I also want to continue to attend and contribute something to the Armstrong Posse, hopefully by running a session or a small group focused on learning Python.

(Intro)

#### Rales Engine

In this project I worked with Nick E to host our first API. We import business data and host an API with endpoints to return records, relationships between models, and business intelligence as JSON. During our evaluation Sally gave us some positive feedback on our organization structure.  test coverage, queries, and git workflow. Overall, our queries all used ActiveRecord except for our random controllers (`Customer.all.sample`).

Evaluator: Sally

Students: Nick E & Kyle


## Project Rubric

1. **Completion**

    * 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

1. **Test-Driven Development**

    * 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

1. **Code Quality**

    * 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

1. **API Design**

    * 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

1. **Queries**

    * 3.5: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

This session was really helpful to think about my priorities when starting to job search. I had not thought too much about the question of what people I like to work with so I enjoyed thinking through what I'm looking for in colleagues. I'm looking forward to using my flower exercise to help with selecting jobs to apply for and interviews.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Nick E (Rales Engine): Overall I loved working with you on Rales Engine and hopefully we get to work together again! My constructive from this project is to have more explicit discussions with teammates about the tradeoff between getting something done and doing it as well as possible (importer tests, for example). My positive feedback is that you do an excellent job problem-solving and knowing the tools to troubleshoot. You also do a great job holding people accountable to using specific vocabulary which lets you have higher level discussions about code more easily.
