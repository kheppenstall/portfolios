# Kyle Heppenstall - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main area of emphasis in this module is to figure out what fields and technologies in software developement I'm most interested in. I want to do more exploring of a new language like Python and Elixir. I'm looking forward to working on a personal project and have the goal of consuming and analyzing some data from a couple APIs and then hosting the collected data in my own API. Concerning the community at large, I want to keep pairing with students in Mod 1 and Mod 2 and continue to make more connections with the people in my own module. I also want to continue to attend and contribute something to the Armstrong Posse, hopefully by running a session or a small group focused on learning Python.

In this project I worked with Nick E to host our first API. We import business data and host an API with endpoints to return records, relationships between models, and business intelligence as JSON. During our evaluation Sally gave us some positive feedback on our organization structure.  test coverage, queries, and git workflow. Overall, our queries all used ActiveRecord except for our random controllers (`Customer.all.sample`).

Evaluator: Sally

Students: Nick E & Kyle


### Project Rubric

1. **Completion**

    * 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.

1. **Test-Driven Development**

    * 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

1. **Code Quality**

    * 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.

1. **API Design**

    * 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.

1. **Queries**

    * 3.5: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

## Cloney Island

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/kickstarter_clone)
*   [Heroku](https://kickstarter2.herokuapp.com/)

For Cloney Island we built a clone of Kickstarter. I learned about making name-specific many to many relationships and more about authorization - specifically how to secure an API and use a permission PORO. I also got some good practice with styling in. The biggest challege was the size of the team and the related project management and git workflow.

Evaluator: Casey

Students: Kyle, Robbie, Jason, Dan, Drew

1. **User Experience**

    *   Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
    *   2.5: As expected
    *   2.5: Below expectations

1. **Organization**

    *   Team used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
    *   3.5: As expected, but great

1. **Git Workflow**

    *   Team always used pull requests and commented on pull requests prior to introducing code into the master branch.
    *   4: Better than expected

1. **Test Quality**

    *   Project is well-tested (Above 90% and the most valuable pieces of the app are covered). If you were paying for someone to build this for you, would you be satisfied with the tests that are written?
    *   4: Better than expected

1. **Code Quality**

    *   Project demonstrates well-factored code and a solid grasp of MVC principles.
    *   4: Better than expected

1. **Bonus**

    * We want to recognize and reward risk-taking and exploration. Sometimes other areas might suffer if the risk doesn't pan out. Earn a bonus point to offset a score above.
    *   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    *   0: No

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

During this gear up we spent the first bit of time exploring the Parable of the Polygons interactive blog post. Applying the ideas to tech, if executives (or anyone making hiring decisions) seeks teams were even one third of the members are like them then there will be segregated availabilities according to who is ‘like’ the decision-maker in this case. To be honest I had not though through diversity quotas too much previously. Based on the Potp, it seems essential to have a threshold for the the maximum number of people like you in your area.  Diversity quotas, even if small, could help provide this threshold. Another way to provide this threshold would be through personal expectations. If you are only willing to work at an area with a certain level of diversity, you are steering the trend toward a more diverse workforce.

#### Automation and the Future

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

We started this gear up watching a few depressing videos on automation. I found it interesting that the videos suggested professional and creative work being automated at rates similar to the blue collar work I traditionally associated with being vulnerable to automation. In groups we started discussing about the impacts automation could have on society going forward. We discussed options like a more significant safety net, lowering the hours in a work week, universal basic income, and lowering the retirement age. We also raised the idea that society needs to change its concept around unemployment - stop blaming the unemployed and consider the option that the person is without a job to no fault of their own.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/kheppenstall/1930f63ab3978c60665a0e804cc72d88/edit)

This session was really helpful to think about my priorities when starting to job search. I had not thought too much about the question of what people I like to work with so I enjoyed thinking through what I'm looking for in colleagues. I'm looking forward to using my flower exercise to help with selecting jobs to apply for and interviews.

#### Innovative Problem Solving

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/innovative_problem-solving.md)

This session was definitely helpful in getting some ideas going for the personal project. I actually came up with an idea I used for my personal project during the session. The idea of not rejecting any ideas and running with each one was helpful for me since I tend to be overly selective instead of just brainstorming openly.

#### How to be successful in interviews

This module I did the interview preparation session with Ian Douglas, mock interview with Ian, and attended the fireside chat with Ingrid Alongi. From the fireside chat I learned a bit about the importance writing a unique, fun cover letter to show interest. We also heard about the automated systems for parsing resumes and how it picks out key words and experience. Ingrid also recommended trying to make a connection with the interviewers. From the session with Ian Douglas I got some great practice trying to respond to technical questions and then went on to practice my responses explaining RESTful APIs and the HTTP request / response cycle. Another thing I picked up is just to be mentally prepared and friendly for the interview. Have fun, be nice, and be yourself.

In this session we dove into creating an action plan to find a job. I enjoyed thinking first about priorities and then transitioning into creating a concrete,actionable plan for module 4. Personally it relieved a lot of stress to just create a weekly plan for looking for and pursuing opportunities. That way I know I have a starting point to begin from and can adjust if it doesn't go as well as I hope.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

For Nick E (Rales Engine): Overall I loved working with you on Rales Engine and hopefully we get to work together again! My constructive from this project is to have more explicit discussions with teammates about the tradeoff between getting something done and doing it as well as possible (importer tests, for example). My positive feedback is that you do an excellent job problem-solving and knowing the tools to troubleshoot. You also do a great job holding people accountable to using specific vocabulary which lets you have higher level discussions about code more easily.
