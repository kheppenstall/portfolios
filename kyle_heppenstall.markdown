Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

Two test files, 47 tests total that all pass
Testing is strong, good progressions, some good edge cases
Implementation is strong, small style refactorings
Has delete, leaves, height

1. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

2. Functional Expectations
  4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

3. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some     refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
  
#### Sorting Suite

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Most of my key takeaways from this essions happened during our conversation debriefing the articles about vetting leaders and whether we have a responsibility to vote. I was interested to hear the perspective that abstaining from an election can be a conscious way to "vote." We also dove into extending the example from the reading that civic responsibilities and rights should strike a balance to keep individuals and government healthy. After this gear up I'm still motivated to vote but am hoping to do some more research to be more informed about local positions.
