# Kyle Heppenstall - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goals for the module are to learn as much as I can and be an effective team member. While working on a team, even if we are frustrated or making progress slowly, I want to continue to put the team first and maintain a solution-oriented attidue. Sometimes I mistakenly prioritize task completion over learning. As a result I want to prioritize asking for help and practicing/repeating to move myself along. Finally I wanted to get more comfortable in the community and start to find my place. I want to pair plenty with people in and outside of my module and make time to be as helpful as I can to the community. One big challenge I am anticipating is staying healthy and making time to cook and exercise.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

I worked through iteration 4 making my first web application. This was the first project I made that required many different classes. As a resut I learned a good bit about workflow and extracting classes. I also used modules for this first time - incorporating them as functions.

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date night was our first big individual project. I retrofitted many of the tests after our lesson on test-driven development. I paired with Ilana and learned a good bit about refactoring and how to improve my style. My biggest struggles on this project were refactoring to improve clarity and writing the health method.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

Two test files, 47 tests total that all pass
Testing is strong, good progressions, some good edge cases
Implementation is strong, small style refactorings
Has delete, leaves, height

1. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

2. Functional Expectations
  4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

3. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some     refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
  
#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

I wrote and tested algorithms for bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, selection sort, and in-place insertion sort. No evaluation.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Amy and I worked together to make the autcomplete using the tries data structure. We learned how to collaborate using git / GitHub and deepend our understanding of data structures and trees. We also learned to populate our automplete with files and figured out how to connect our code to .txt files. We did the delete option and did the SimpleCov extension for the project. As our first paired project I learned a good bit about being a strong team member and setting up expectations for the team to succeed.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

Spec harness: runs, though copied instead of cloned, passes
Project tests do a good job of using multiple perspectives/angles
Watch out for testing the internal functionality -- test the external interface
Tests are well built/implemented
Good inclusion of edgecases
Implementation is very good from a code quality/style standpoint
Built delete and used SimpleCov
Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, refactoring, and extensively uses idiomatic code.

4. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

5. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

Feedback to me: Most of my key takeaways from this session happened during our conversation debriefing the articles about vetting leaders and whether we have a responsibility to vote. I was interested to hear the perspective that abstaining from an election can be a conscious way to "vote." We also dove into extending the example from the reading that civic responsibilities and rights should strike a balance to keep individuals and government healthy. After this gear up I'm still motivated to vote but am hoping to do some more research to be more informed about local positions.

Feedback from me: I provided Amy with some similar constructive feedback that she provided to me. We did not communicate enough over the weekend so that we ended up with at very different points when we came in on Monday. More frequent check-ins with the partner would have led to higher productivity and less time getting back on the same page when we met up on Monday. I provided her with some positive feedback on her flexibility and ability to notice details about code. I gave her some positive feedback on her ability to balance building a relationship with her partner while creating a really efficient working relationship.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Session Name)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

One big takeaway for me came from the video. We as a society have a bias against introversion. The idea that creativity comes exclusively from collaboration is faulty. The world is in many ways designed for extroverts even though the whole world stands to benefit from more empowerment of introverts.

Another idea I am taking away from the gear up is the Amazon meeting structure setup by Jeff Bezos. I like the idea of having time to digest and read before conversing, weighing ideas, and making decisions. I also think it is interesting that extroverts lead passive groups better and introverts lead practice groups better. I wonder if a strong leader can change their style depending on the group they are leading.

During our discussion we didnâ€™t arrive at any concrete suggestions for Turing but concluded that introverts and extroverts (from our group at least) feel welcome and like they can be successful. We dove a bit into stereotypes surrounding introverts and disconnecting introverts from shyness and an inability to collaborate.

#### Vote Your Conscience

### Professional Development Workshops

(takeaways from session)

#### Feedback I

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/feedback_1.md)
* Deliverable - see feedback in portfolio

We read about three emotional triggers that can happen when receiving feedback and dove into those by discussing how we feel when we receive feedback. We then practiced writing some feedback to implement on our first project.

#### Learning to Pair: Holding Each Other Accountable, and Giving Feedback

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables - DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NymvDNiOQUi6tp7JkjFA4eGKSM1pXh8Wgwxw-yDgAY/edit)

My biggest takeaways from learning to pair were around managing my expectations and how to communicate with another person to match our expectations. From exploring my own strengths, I think I bring a strong ability to focus for extended periods, a flexible schedule, and high accountability for task completion. One thing I am hoping to work on is using the tools Allison provided to effectively deal with conflict in a pair. We practiced having some tough "retro" conversations, and I would like to be able to use those to effectively work through difficult situations with my teams.
